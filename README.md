# React 18 Typescript Webpack with SWC-Loader no CRA

Hey there fellow developers. I created this React Webpack template to see if I could achieve speeds similar to Vite. This required me to use the [SWC-Loader](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/swc-loader). Also the Webpack config is in TS. 
If for some reason you want a modern React app with Webpack and don't want to use [Nx](https://nx.dev/nx-api/webpack), hopefully this template can work for you.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Development

1. Run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits and save your changes.
2. Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Don't forget to update the `README.md` file to reflect your project's details.
